    "Scrape at least 100 recipes from the web, provide their ingredient lists and clean the ingredient data for the further calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will have three main tasks:\n",
    "- scraping data: scrape at least 100 recipes from the website that you choose\n",
    "- cleaning data: clean your ingredient data for further calculation. This includes, but is not limited to, removing excess white spaces, correcting for all edge cases, and correcting any remaining formatting issues\n",
    "- calculating: what are the 10 most common ingredients used in these recipes?"

    "### About the website\n",
    "\n",
    "While starting on this assignment, I came across this website called allrecipes.com. While analyzing the structure of the website to begin scrapping, I realized that the website is very well structured and it would be fairly easy to extract data from this. Also, the website has a lot of recipes from various cuisines and seems to be wellmaintained and moderated in terms of the recipes. Thus, I chose to work with this website.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 1: Web Scrapping Recipes\n",
    "\n",
    "There were two approaches that I considered to complete this task. \n",
    "- Approach 1: To extract required information from the HTML front end, directly use code to download the HTML contents and extract out useful information using requests and regex. \n",
    "- Approach 2: To extract required information from the HTML front end, directly use code to download the HTML contents and extract out useful information using using requests and Beautiful Soup.\n",
    "\n",
    "About:\n",
    "- Regular Expression (shortened as regex): It is a sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern in text.\n",
    "- Requests: It is a Python module in which you can send HTTP requests to retrieve contents. It helps you to access website HTML contents by sending Get or Post requests.\n",
    "- Beautiful Soup: It helps you parse the HTML or XML documents into a readable format. It allows you to search different elements within the documents and help you retrieve required information faster."

    "So, I checked out if all of these recipes with the base url have a similar HTML structure. To do this, I took a couple of pages at random and checked the structure. For demonstration here, I have provided the HTML structure of one such page. "

    "\n",
    "There is another way of going about the scrapping task. If website stores data in API and the website queries the API each time when user visit the website, you can simulate the request and directly query data from the API. It is definitely a preferred approach if you can find the API request. The data you receive will be more structured and stable. This is because compared to the website front end, it is less likely for the company to change its backend API. However, I could not find API for allrecipes.com. \n",

    "Another approach for Task 2: Named Entity Recognition\n",
    "Named Entity Recognition (NER) can be used to extract ingredient name from the unstructured text. Named Entity Recognition is one of the first tasks of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entity mentioned in unstructed text into pre-defined categories such as people, organizations etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a custom named entity recongition model, we need training data which is annonated in the format specified by spacy documentation. I attempted this approach as well.  I am still in the process of structuring the code for this approach. So, for the purpose of this demonstration, I have not added that approach here. If needed, I can provide the code for the same. \n",

    "### Takeaway:\n",
    "As a Data Science student, I have always believed that Data Science is not just about fancy Machine Learning algorithms. It involves a lot more than fitting just ML models. Understanding the problem, Data gathering, Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering are few of the tasks. In this assignment, I not only understood the problem statement and got the answers, I gathered my own data based on the problem statement, I cleaned the data and then performed calculation and reached the end goal. Even though there is still a scope for improvement (which I am working on), I had a fun time working on this end-to-end project! I am hoping to get to work on more such projects.  "
